# AB_Testing

This folder contains previous work I have done on conducting AB Testing

__AB_testing_exercise.ipynb__

In this exercise, I perform A/B testing using Python on an e-commerce company's new website home page. The company wants to test a new version of its home page. The company's previous home page had a conversion rate of only 13%. The company is hoping that the new design of its home page will increase the conversion rate by at least 2%. I use an A/B test to determine if the conversion rate will indeed go up or down by 2%.
